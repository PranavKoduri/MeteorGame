# Meteor Rush
## Made by Pranav Koduri

NOTE: High scores may not save/display correctly.

Meteors are constantly falling from the sky and you need to either dodge them or shoot them. You win by surviving the six stages of meteor falls, but the real challenge is destroying as many meteors as possible to increase your score as much as you can. But be careful - get hit by a meteor once and you instantly lose!

## Game Controls
- "A" or left arrow key to move left
- "D" or right arrow key to move right
- "W", "S", up arrow key or down arrow key to shoot (directly up)
- "P" or space bar to pause and unpause
- "Q" to quit
- "R" to reset

## Resetting
- Press "R" at any time to reset and go to the title screen.
- If you reset while in the middle of a game, your score won't be saved.
- Once the game is done and you win/lose, you can reset to play again without having to quit the program and start it again. Your score will be saved.

## Scoring
- Your score is displayed in the topleft corner while in game.
- You earn points for every tenth of a second you stay alive, surviving one of the six stages of meteor falls, and destroying a meteor with the rover.
- If you survive until the end without destroying a single meteor, your score will be 30695.
- If you survive until the end while destroying every meteor, your score will be 58745 - this is the highest possible score. However, this score is impossible to achieve because of the meteor spawning speed and rover reloading speed in the later stages.
- This means meteors alone are worth almost 30000 points! You can just try to dodge them and stay alive to win, but your score will be very low.

## Ammo
- Your current ammo is displayed in the topright corner while in game.
- Your ammo automatically reloads when you are not at full ammo.
- Obviously you can only shoot when you have at least one ammo.

## Stages
- There are six stages in the game. Each stage lasts about 30 seconds, so the entire game lasts about 3 minutes.
- Each stage your max ammo increases and almost completely refills, the meteors get smaller and faster, and the meteors spawn faster.
- At stage 5, the meteors' health increase so you need two shots instead of one to take them out. To help with this, the rover's reload speed also increases in the final stages.
- Stage changes are not subtle. Here are the different ways you can detect a stage change:
  - Your score suddenly jumps up a significant amount
  - The meteors stop spawning for a couple seconds
  - Your ammo instantly reloads almost completely and your max ammo increases

## High Scores Page
- Your top 10 high scores are saved. You can clear them at any time.
- When you press C to clear the high scores and don't want to clear while the confirmation pop-up is displayed, press B or R to go back and keep your high scores.
